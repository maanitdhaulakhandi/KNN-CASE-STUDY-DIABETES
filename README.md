# KNN-CASE-STUDY-DIABETES
This repository contains a Machine Learning case study focused on predicting diabetes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project demonstrates end-to-end implementation including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.
This repository presents a Machine Learning case study that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and performance evaluation.

 Problem Statement:

To build a classification model that predicts diabetes based on medical attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, insulin level, and other diagnostic measurements.
